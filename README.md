# SimpleMoneyTransferAppBackend
hey guys this project contains a simple backend using mongo db as database, node and express in the backend along with jwt for authorisation and zod for authentication.This is a very simple project and very basic so all the people who are new to this can try recreating something like this. Soon I will be pushing the frontend as well.
