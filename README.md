# SimpleMoneyTransferAppBackend
Hey guys this project contains a simple backend using mongo db as database, node and express in the backend along with jwt for authorisation and zod for authentication.This is a very simple project and very basic so all the people who are new to this can try recreating something like this. Soon I will be pushing the frontend as well which will be on React.
All those who want to use this project feel free to use this but make sure you have you mongodb connection link ready with you and paste it in db.js file.



Thank you and feel free to update this simple project
